       <h1> Tourism System </h1>
        <p>Tourism in Sri Lanka is growing rapidly. For centuries, Sri Lanka has been a popular 
            place of attraction for foreign travelers. The Chinese traveler Fa-Hien visited Sri Lanka 
            as early as the 410's AD/CE, and in the twelfth century, Italian explorer Marco Polo 
            claimed Sri Lanka to be the "best island of its size in the world".</p>
